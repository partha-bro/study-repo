## what id difference between div and span?
	
	-> Span and Div are both generic HTML elements that group together related parts of a web page. 
	A Div element is used for block-level organisation and styling of page elements, whereas a Span element is used for inline organisation and styling.
	a Div element has height and width value, but span doesn't.


	examples of inline element: span tag, image tag, anchors
	others like div, h1, p, etc are block element.

## what id difference between block element and inline element?

	-> Inline elements do not force a new line to begin in the document flow.
	Block elements, on other hand, typically cause a line break to occur (although, as usual, this can be changed using CSS)
